The Bontempi PM 678 is part of the Bontempi brand, which is an Italian company that specializes in musical instruments and toys. Bontempi was founded in 1937 by Alessandro and Antonio Bontempi, and it has since become one of the leading manufacturers of keyboards, organs, guitars, drums, microphones, and wind instruments.

Some of the advantages of the Bontempi PM 678 are:
 
- It has a wide range of sounds and rhythms that cover various musical genres, such as rock, pop, jazz, blues, country, classical, and more.
- It has a General Midi compatibility feature that allows it to communicate with other MIDI devices and software. This means that the keyboard can play back MIDI files from a computer or a smartphone, or control other MIDI instruments or sound modules.
- It has an Easy Play function that simplifies the playing of chords by using only one finger. This helps beginners to learn the basics of harmony and accompaniment.
- It has an Arranger function that automatically adds bass and chord accompaniment to the melody played on the keyboard. This creates a full-band sound and enhances the musical expression.
- It has 32 pre-recorded songs that can be used for learning or entertainment. The songs include popular tunes such as "Happy Birthday", "Jingle Bells", "Ode to Joy", "Greensleeves", and more.

Some of the disadvantages of the Bontempi PM 678 are:

- It has a limited polyphony of 16 notes, which means that it can only play up to 16 sounds at the same time. This can cause some notes to drop out or cut off when playing complex chords or melodies.
- It does not have a touch-sensitive keyboard, which means that it does not respond to the pressure or velocity of the keys. This can affect the dynamics and expression of the music.
- It does not have a USB port or an SD card slot, which means that it cannot store or transfer data to or from external devices. This limits the options for expanding or updating the keyboard's features.

The Bontempi PM 678 is a digital keyboard that offers a variety of sounds and rhythms for different musical styles and genres. It also has a General Midi compatibility feature that allows it to connect with other MIDI devices and software. However, it also has some limitations in terms of polyphony, touch sensitivity, and data storage. The keyboard is suitable for beginners and intermediate players who want to have fun and learn music with an affordable and easy-to-use instrument.
